## Overview

cdesktop is an open-source alternative to Anthropic's [Claude Code Desktop](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/desktop-quickstart). It's a web UI for 5 coding agents — Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI, OpenCode, and Hermes — wrapping each CLI as a child process on your machine, with your code, transcripts, and worktrees all kept on disk.

The layout is modeled after the Code tab of Anthropic's official desktop app: a sessions sidebar, a transcript with an integrated terminal and diff viewer, and a right-side pane for plan, files, and app preview. Unlike the official app, cdesktop is local-only, agent-agnostic, and provider-agnostic — pick an agent, pick a provider from the built-in catalog or wire up your own.

**As of May 7, 2026, Anthropic's Claude Code Desktop no longer accepts third-party model names.** cdesktop fully supports third-party providers and models.

- **5 coding agents in one UI** — Claude Code, Codex, Gemini, OpenCode, Hermes; pick per session, transcripts stay separate per agent
- **Plug in any provider in one click** — 20+ built-in presets (OpenRouter, AWS Bedrock, DeepSeek, Kimi, ModelScope, MiniMax, Nvidia, …) or add a custom `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` endpoint; switch providers and tune reasoning effort per session
- **Agent teams** — spawn teammates that share your workspace and divide work; mix agents and models per teammate; lead delegates via `npx cdesktop team spawn`
- **Run sessions side by side** — split the workspace into up to 4 cells and drag any session into a new cell
- **Switch between sessions instantly** — no reload between threads; transcripts stay where you left them
- **Routines** — schedule recurring agent runs (hourly, daily, weekdays, weekly) or save manual-fire templates; each run spawns its own workspace you can open and review
- **Optional Git worktrees** — opt in per project for an isolated branch per session, or work directly in the folder; non-Git directories work too
- **Review diffs and leave inline comments** — send feedback directly to the agent without leaving the UI
- **Preview your app** — built-in browser with devtools, inspect mode, and device emulation
- **Create pull requests and merge** — open PRs with AI-generated descriptions, review on GitHub, and merge
- **Speaks your language** — built-in support for English, Simplified/Traditional Chinese, Spanish, French, Japanese, and Korean
- **Works on your phone** — fully responsive UI; check progress, review diffs, and send follow-ups from any device
- **Runs in your browser today** — start with `npx cdesktop` and open it in any modern browser; a Tauri desktop build is wired up but not yet shipped

> **Beta software.** Expect bugs and rough edges. Please [file issues](https://github.com/cdesktop-ai/cdesktop/issues) when you hit them.

## Installation

```bash
npx cdesktop
```

## Roadmap

- **Desktop app build** — ship Tauri installers for macOS, Windows, and Linux
- **Voice input** — push-to-talk dictation for hands-free prompts
- **Files panel** — browse the full project file tree, not just the session working directory
- **Performance optimization** — faster cold start, smaller bundle, lower idle CPU
- **Skill browser** — in-app discovery and one-click install for slash commands and skills

## Support

File bug reports and feature requests at [cdesktop-ai/cdesktop/issues](https://github.com/cdesktop-ai/cdesktop/issues).

## Contributing

Please raise ideas and changes in [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/cdesktop-ai/cdesktop/discussions) before opening a PR, so we can align on implementation details and roadmap fit.

## Development

### Prerequisites

- [Rust](https://rustup.rs/) (latest stable)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (>=20)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) (>=8)

Additional development tools:
```bash
cargo install cargo-watch
cargo install sqlx-cli
```

Install dependencies:
```bash
pnpm i
```

### Running the dev server

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

This will start the backend and web app. A blank DB will be copied from the `dev_assets_seed` folder.

### Building the web app

To build just the web app:

```bash
cd packages/local-web
pnpm run build
```

### Build from source (macOS)

1. Run `./local-build.sh`
2. Test with `cd npx-cli && node bin/cli.js`

### Environment Variables

The following environment variables can be configured at build time or runtime:

| Variable | Type | Default | Description |
|----------|------|---------|-------------|
| `POSTHOG_API_KEY` | Build-time | Empty | PostHog analytics API key (disables analytics if empty) |
| `POSTHOG_API_ENDPOINT` | Build-time | Empty | PostHog analytics endpoint (disables analytics if empty) |
| `PORT` | Runtime | Auto-assign | **Production**: Server port. **Dev**: Frontend port (backend uses PORT+1) |
| `BACKEND_PORT` | Runtime | `0` (auto-assign) | Backend server port (dev mode only, overrides PORT+1) |
| `FRONTEND_PORT` | Runtime | `3000` | Frontend dev server port (dev mode only, overrides PORT) |
| `HOST` | Runtime | `127.0.0.1` | Backend server host |
| `MCP_HOST` | Runtime | Value of `HOST` | MCP server connection host (use `127.0.0.1` when `HOST=0.0.0.0` on Windows) |
| `MCP_PORT` | Runtime | Value of `BACKEND_PORT` | MCP server connection port |
| `DISABLE_WORKTREE_CLEANUP` | Runtime | Not set | Disable all git worktree cleanup including orphan and expired workspace cleanup (for debugging) |
| `CDT_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` | Runtime | Not set | Comma-separated list of origins that are allowed to make backend API requests (e.g., `https://my-cdesktop.example.com`) |

**Build-time variables** must be set when running `pnpm run build`. **Runtime variables** are read when the application starts.

#### Self-Hosting with a Reverse Proxy or Custom Domain

When running cdesktop behind a reverse proxy (e.g., nginx, Caddy, Traefik) or on a custom domain, you must set the `CDT_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` environment variable. Without this, the browser's Origin header won't match the backend's expected host, and API requests will be rejected with a 403 Forbidden error.

Set it to the full origin URL(s) where your frontend is accessible:

```bash
# Single origin
CDT_ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://cdesktop.example.com

# Multiple origins (comma-separated)
CDT_ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://cdesktop.example.com,https://cdesktop-staging.example.com
```

### Remote Deployment

When running cdesktop on a remote server (e.g., via systemctl, Docker, or cloud hosting), you can configure your editor to open projects via SSH:

1. **Access via tunnel**: Use Cloudflare Tunnel, ngrok, or similar to expose the web UI
2. **Configure remote SSH** in Settings → Editor Integration:
   - Set **Remote SSH Host** to your server hostname or IP
   - Set **Remote SSH User** to your SSH username (optional)
3. **Prerequisites**:
   - SSH access from your local machine to the remote server
   - SSH keys configured (passwordless authentication)
   - VSCode Remote-SSH extension

When configured, the "Open in VSCode" buttons will generate URLs like `vscode://vscode-remote/ssh-remote+user@host/path` that open your local editor and connect to the remote server.

See the [documentation](https://cdesktop.ai) for detailed setup instructions.
